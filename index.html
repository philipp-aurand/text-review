        <p class="intro">The <a class="breed"href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">
       briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as<br/>
       as a herder and guardian of sheep.
      <h3>Breed History</h3> 
        <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to<br/>
    herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries,<br/>
    messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing.<br/>
    Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the<br/>
    population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson<br/>
    and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
